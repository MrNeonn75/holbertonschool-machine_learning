    Normalizes an unactivated output of a neural network using
    batch normalization.

    Args:
        Z (numpy.ndarray):
            The input data of shape (m, n) to be normalized, where
            m is the number of data points and n is the number of features.
        gamma (numpy.ndarray):
            The scales used for batch normalization, shape (1, n).
        beta (numpy.ndarray):
            The offsets used for batch normalization, shape (1, n).
        epsilon (float):
            A small number to avoid division by zero.

    Returns:
        numpy.ndarray: The batch-normalized output, same shape as Z.
