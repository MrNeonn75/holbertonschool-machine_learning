    Normalizes (standardizes) a matrix by subtracting the mean
    and dividing by the standard deviation.

    Args:
        X (numpy.ndarray): A 2D array of shape (d, nx) to normalize, where:
            - d is the number of data points.
            - nx is the number of features.
        m (numpy.ndarray): A 1D array of shape (nx,) that contains the mean
        of all features of X.
        s (numpy.ndarray): A 1D array of shape (nx,) that contains the standard
        deviation of all features of X.

        numpy.ndarray: A normalized (standardized) version of X with the same
        shape as the input.
